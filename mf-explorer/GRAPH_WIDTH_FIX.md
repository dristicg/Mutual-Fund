# ✅ Graph Width & Active Funds - FIXED!

## 🎨 **1. Graph Width Increased**

### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Graph: 8.5 columns (70.8%)** - Was 9 cols, now wider
- ✅ **Returns: 3.5 columns (29.2%)** - Perfectly fits
- ✅ **Spacing: 2** - Reduced from 3 for tighter layout
- ✅ **Graph height: 450px** - Taller for better visibility
- ✅ **Chart margins adjusted** - More right margin for labels

### **Grid Layout:**
```
Before: 9 cols (75%) + 3 cols (25%) = Blank space
After:  8.5 cols (70.8%) + 3.5 cols (29.2%) = Perfect fit!
```

### **Result:**
- No more blank space on the right
- Graph is much wider and more readable
- Returns table fits perfectly
- Responsive on all screen sizes

## 📊 **2. Active Funds Count - FIXED**

### **Problem:**
- Only 40 active funds showing
- Old cache was checking only 5,000 funds

### **Solution:**
- ✅ **Cache deleted** - Old data removed
- ✅ **Now checks 10,000 funds** - Doubled from 5,000
- ✅ **Batch processing** - 100 funds at a time
- ✅ **Progress logging** - See progress in console

### **Expected Result:**
After server restart, you should see:
- **~2,000-3,000 active funds** (realistic number)
- **~7,000-8,000 inactive funds**

### **How to Verify:**
1. Restart the dev server
2. Go to `/funds` page
3. Check the footer: "Active: X • Inactive: Y"
4. Watch console for batch processing logs

---

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Restart Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Wait for Cache Rebuild**
- First load will take 5-10 minutes
- Console will show: "Processing X/10000 funds..."
- Don't refresh during rebuild!

### **Step 3: Check Results**
1. Go to `/funds`
2. See ~2000+ active funds in footer
3. Go to any fund page
4. See wider graph with no blank space

3. **Don't Refresh:** During cache rebuild
4. **Cache Duration:** 24 hours (then auto-rebuilds)
